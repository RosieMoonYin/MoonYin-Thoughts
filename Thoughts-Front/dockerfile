# Step 1: Use an official Node.js image to build the app
FROM node:16 AS build

# Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Step 5: Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the app for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 7: Use an official Nginx image to serve the app
FROM nginx:stable-alpine

# Step 8: Copy the built files from the previous stage to Nginx's default location
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Step 9: Expose the port Nginx will run on (default is 80)
EXPOSE 80

# Step 10: Start Nginx when the container starts
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
